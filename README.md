    Hi, my name is deivid and I'm fourteen years old
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
I'm a young engineer and programmer with great experience in robotics competitions, including Rescue Line, FLL, and CoderZ
</h2>

<p>
During my four years in robotics, I discovered a strong passion for programming and engineering. By fully leveraging available tools and technologies, and working alongside the Born to Fight Team, I was able to achieve new levels of excellence and reach ambitious goals.

<p>  
I'm actively pursuing international recognition in robotics, with the goal of competing in the Flying Robots Trial League and other high-level autonomous robotics challenges.
