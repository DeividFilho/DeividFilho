    Hi
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
I'm a young engineer and programmer with great experience in robotics competitions, including Rescue Line, FLL, and CoderZ
</h2>

<p>
During my four years in robotics, I discovered a strong passion for programming and engineering. By fully leveraging available tools and technologies, and working alongside the Born to Fight Team, I was able to achieve new levels of excellence and reach ambitious goals.
</p>

<p>
    After achieving first place in two robotics national competitions (Competição Brasileira de Robótica 2021/2022) I started focusing more in open source contributions and exploring new areas.
    I'm currently developping my skills on firmware engineering, working mainly with freeRTOS, as well as IoT connectivity.
</p>

### Here are some of my skills
