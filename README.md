    After achieving first place in two robotics national competitions (Competição Brasileira de Robótica 2021/2022) I started focusing more in open source contributions and exploring new areas.
    I'm currently developping my skills on firmware engineering, working mainly with freeRTOS, as well as IoT connectivity.
